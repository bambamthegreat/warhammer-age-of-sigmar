Vostarg Lodge is Missing the Command Trait “FIERY ENDURANCE- Friendly VOSTARG units wholly whithin 12” of this model at the start of your movement phase can run in that movement phase and still charge later in the same turn.”
Also I see that the NEW Warband Battalions for the Vostarg lodge don’t have information on the Battalions.”LORDS OF VOSTARG-Strength in Tradition:Once per battle round, a HERO can use a command ability without a command point being spent.”
“VOSTARG WARRIOR KINBAND-Mighty Deeds and Blazing Oaths: Add 1 to attack’s characteristics of melee weapons used by VULKITE BERZERKER units in this Battalion while they are wholly within 12” of this Battalions AURIC RUNESON.”
“VOSTARG FORGE BRETHREN-Heir of the Fyreheart Temple: If a friendly unit of AURIC HEARTHGUARD from this Battalion is wholly within 12” of Dhurgan when he uses his Magmic Prayer of Runic Empowerment ability, the prayer is answered on a 2+ instead of a 3+.”
“THE GRAND FYRD OF FURIOUS PEAK-Ancestral Fury: Add 1 to Hit rolls for attack’s made with melee weapons by unit from this Battalion. In addition, If the target is a CHAOS unit, You can Re-roll Wound rolls of 1 for melee attacks.”
That’s all I got for now,lol on a side note I’m not sure if this is a problem or I just don’t know how to do it but I can’t make units from my
Battalions BATTLELINE without adding more points to my army. I hope
This helps and I love this app!!!!!😁🤙😁🤙
